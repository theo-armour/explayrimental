Welcome [3D Coder Readers]( http://the3dwebcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/08/hackergarten-chromium-and-markdown.html#comment-2222672923 )!

This page shows several fun things you can do with the [Showdown]( https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown ) Markdown interpreter - especially with files hosted on GitHub.

1. [Index.html]( https://github.com/theo-armour/explayrimental/blob/gh-pages/tammik/showdown/index.html ) is set up so as to automatically read a file named 'readme.md' and turn Markdown into HTML.
If, however, there is file named using location hash then index.html will translate and display that file.
The two links below are examples of this use.

2. If the file is on GitHub then you can use the [GitHub Pages]( https://pages.github.com/ ) feature to publish files as web pages.
In this case, you can read the file as GitHub source code or as an HTML web page.
The benefit is that you can use GitHub Markdown to build simple web sites and have exactly the same text appear as the read me files descriptions of the source code.
At the top of this page there is a button or link that transfers you from one view to the other.
